# Anchor Escrow 2025

## ðŸ†• Now updated for Solana kit, Kite, and Codama.

![CI Badge](https://github.com/mikemaccana/anchor-escrow-2025/actions/workflows/tests.yaml/badge.svg)

It's often said that all other programs are modification of an Escrow app, so if you want an example of a Solana app that does something with actual value, here's the best place to start.

Anchor Escrow 2025 has:

- Always tested on latest Rust, Agave CLI, node.js, Anchor, and Solana Kit.
- Zero warnings, zero errors. So that you can see if things work or not without a screen full of unrelated junk.
- npm and node.js used for tests, no third-party package managers or test runners.

Check out the [full animated explanation from the TURBIN3 channel on YouTube](https://github.com/mikemaccana/professional-education) repo which has an [animated explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMB_OqLIeGw&t=1s) of the program.

This repo is [designed for teaching and learning](CHANGELOG.md).

## Introduction

This Solana program is called an **_escrow_** - it allows a user to swap a specific amount of one token for a desired amount of another token.

For example, Alice is offering 10 USDC, and wants 100 WIF in return.

Without our program, users would have to either:

- Use traditional finance, where a third party would take between 1-6% of the value of the transaction.
- Engage in manual token swapping. Imagine the potential problems if Bob promised to send Alice 100 WIF, but instead took the 10 USDC and ran? Or what if Alice was dishonest, received the 10 USDC from Bob, and decided not to send the 100 WIF? Our Escrow program handles these complexities by acting a trusted entity that will only release tokens to both parties at the right time.

Our Escrow program is designed to provide a secure environment for users to swap a specific amount of one token with a specific amount of another token without having to trust each other.

Better yet, since our program allows Alice and Bob to transact directly with each other, they both get a hundred percent of the token they desire!

## Versions

You can check the versions on your own machine with:

```bash
echo "Solana CLI: $(solana -V)\nAnchor: $(anchor --version)\nNode: $(node --version)\nRust: $(rustc -V)"
```

This repo was tested with:

```
Solana CLI: solana-cli 2.1.13 (src:67412607; feat:1725507508, client:Agave)

If you use other versions, you should be aware that things may not work.

## Usage

Then `anchor test`, `anchor deploy` etc.
